                    The repayments as calculated in the dedicated repayment schedule, are done on the basis of payment at regular agreed intervals. If the due date for a payment instalment falls on a non-business day, then the repayment may be paid on the next business day.

                    </span>
                    The Lender will calculate interest at a flat rate on the daily balance outstanding (after adjustment is made for cheques in the course of collection), meaning that interest is charged on the principal outstanding at each month end and the amount of interest paid each month reduces over the term of the Loan.

                    The Lender shall compound interest on the Loan at such interval as it shall determine at its sole discretion.
